# UNCC Store

**Description:** A mock e-commerce store with supplies for UNCC students.

To access admin functions, use the following credentials:
- Email: admin@admin.com
- Password: admin

To use the program run the main.java file and follow the terminal instructions

**Disclaimer:** Do not use any real emails or passwords, as the program is not secure.

I wanted to use an UI for this project like I said in my other milestones but since I have been sick this past week I was unable to learn and implemnt an UI in time. The entire program is text based.

The program saves all data when closed such as orderhistory, users, and products.
